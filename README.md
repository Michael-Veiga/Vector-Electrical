## Review

This is the first project that i've undertaken for an actual business. It allowed me to test and enhance my skills with React and CSS animations. It also gave me alot of experience with implementing customer input and explaining relatively complex topics simply, as to steer the client in the right direction. This project definitely tested my understanding of media queries, especially because the css animations required a lot of customization. In fact, the frame rate for the jumbotron lightning is currently not as smooth on Firefox as it is on Google Chrome, and after doing some research i've found that the way the animation is implemented is only half supported on Firefox, so an update will be required post production.
